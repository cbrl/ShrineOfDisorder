# Shrine of Disorder

Modifies the Shrine of Order behavior for more fun and less pain.

By default, this mod will make the Shrine of Order randomize items per-stack instead of per-tier. This means you will still have the same number of unique stacks after using the shrine, instead of one stack per item tier, meaning the shrine is not necessarily a death sentence any longer.
The Shrine of Order will now also have the ability to spawn on every map, giving more opportunities to use it.

## Changelog

**1.1.0**

- A good shrine weight is determined using the weight of shrines that are already in the rotation.
- Fixed the default behavior to match what is described.
- Fixed a bug that caused only one item of each tier to be given with the RandomizeItems behavior.

**1.0.0**

- Initial release
